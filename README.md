help 	    - Show all commands or display information about a specific command.

quit 	    - Exit the console.

EOF 	    - Exit the console.

*create, destroy and update commands save changes into a JSON file.

create 	  - create <class_name>

show 	    - show <class_name> <object_id> ; <class_name>.show(<object_id>)()

destroy 	- destroy <class_name> <object_id ; <class_name>.destroy(<object_id>)()

all 	    - all <class_name> ; <class_name>.all()

update 	  - update <class_name> <object_id> <attribute name> “<attribute value>” ; <class name>.update(<object_id>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>) ; <class name>.update(<object_id>, <dictionary representation>)

help 	    - help ; help <command_name>

quit 	    - quit

EOF 	    - EOF ; (ctrl + d)

Storage

All the classes are handled by the Storage engine in the FileStorage Class.  
  
4.Testing - Unittest modules
All the test are defined in the tests folder.

  Documentation
Modules:
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'

  Classes:
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'

  Functions (inside and outside a class):
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
and
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'

Python Unit Tests
